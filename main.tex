\section*{Introduction}
Languages death is a major cultural issue on our planet.
On the aprroximately 7,000 languages in the world, more than half of them are endengared.
It is estimated that one language is dying every two weeks.
90 \% of the languages are expected to disappear with the current generation \cite{death}.
In this context, it is important to come up with models to explain this death so that policies can be adapted.
Many models focused on the properties of the languages like grammar or syntax were developed.
Here we restrict ourselves to the mathematical models in the framework of dynamical systems.
